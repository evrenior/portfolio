		Online-based project developed to give users the ability to classify social network posts, 
		news and tweets to provide an all in one page service with bootstrap styled site.
		 In this project, my role was to create PHP structure of code custom. 
		 The system had to be able to work with popular social networks in the Russian 
		 segment of internet, using their API’s: Facebook API, VK.com API and Twitter API. 
		 After the main work with connection was done, the PM moved me to UI department to 
		 make cross browser makeup for internal pages: categories, Meta setup, to create look and 
		 feel of the site making it user friendly. Developed in JavaScript incorporating DOM elements.
