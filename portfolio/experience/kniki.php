		less effort than other competitors by using a cloud service. Kniki.ru Inc. was a part 
		of open Belarussian software community and the first goal was to get files by parts 
		or entirely, with less time. The download time for highly valued files has been set by 
		PHP to the higher level priority, to clean all the Client-server channel space and to
