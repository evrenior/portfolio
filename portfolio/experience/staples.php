		I start working with Staples as a print center associate, 
		where I found good team and management, who make their work 
		with high level of professionalism. Experience of working as a part 
		of fast growing team and learning, while doing is a great process. 
		I discover more of my talents on multitasking and communication-sales skills. 
		My responsibility and concentration on teamâ€™s tasks went to a higher level.
